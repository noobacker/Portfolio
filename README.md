you can visit portfolio with this link :- https://noobacker.github.io/Portfolio/

# Importants points to note about this website :- 
1. It is only desktop supported (not worked on the different display orientation/resolutions).
2. Since every file needs to exist in the same directory to be hosted, I've added the entire project folder separately, which you can refer to.
3. You can clone and use this project for free (Credits given will be appreciated).
